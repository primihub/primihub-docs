```
First, make sure that Meta service is started successfully.If normal, replace `127.0.0.1` in the `config/node*.yaml` file with your host IP.
```bash
host_ip=`hostname -I | awk '{print $1}'`
sed -ri 's/127.0.0.1/'$host_ip'/g' config/node*.yaml
```
You also need to specify the IP address of the host when launching a task after starting normally, e.g. MPC task
```bash
./primihub-cli --server="ä½ çš„IP:50050" --task_config_file="example/mpc_lr_task_conf.json"
```
